The print command has ()s after it like so print()
It can print letters numbers and variables
# is the comment character

For some odd reason the print("string", 1 + 2) fails I do not understand why
Its because you were using python 2.0 derp
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PEMDAS isnt as simple as the acronym suggests its actually better represented
as PE (M&D) (A&S) so Parenthesis, exponents THEN Multiplication and division happen at the same time and
addition and subtraction happen at the same time after that.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables are easily declared in python just varaible name = something
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
f is a formatting character and is used to reference variables inside strings
for example print(f"My age is {my_age}.") pretty simple but keep in mind that in
a print statement the f goes INSIDE the Parenthesis but outside the quotations
