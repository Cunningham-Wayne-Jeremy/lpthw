From here on out I will log my errors within python with an explanation of what they mean.
BIG mistke 1
phyton ex7.py
This runs python 2.7 which is INCOMPATIBLE with 3.6 and that is why my phython had errors in it....
ERROR 2
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex8.py", line 7, in <module>
    print(formatter.format("one", 'two', 'three', "four"))
IndexError: tuple index out of range
CAUSE: This is due to me not using enough variables to assign to the formatter vairable which I changed to 5 variables

ERROR 3
  File "ex11.py", line 11
    
    ^
SyntaxError: unexpected EOF while parsing

CAUSE:unterminated qoutation

ERROR 4
This was due to an UNTERMINATED ) on the PREVIOUS LINE that is definitly a thing. If you get an error on one line look at the previous line TOO

ERROR 5 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex11.py", line 15, in <module>
    dowhatiwant = input("I am becoming more dangerous wouldnt you say",end=' ')

CAUSE: You cant include end=' ' at the end of an input you will get an error dowhatiwant = input("I am becoming more dangerous wouldnt you say",end=' ')

CAUSE: this is caused when using a module and you only defined a couple of variables and you exceeded that amount

ERROR 8 
 File "ex18.py", line 4

    def print_two_again(arg1,arg2)
